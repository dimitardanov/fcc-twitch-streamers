# Website to check Twitch streamers status


### User Stories:

1. I can see whether FreeCodeCamp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.

2. I can click the status output  and be sent directly to the FreeCodeCamp's Twitch channel.

3. If a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.

4. I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). You can verify this works by adding brunofin and customer404 to your array of Twitch streamers.
